# Purrmanent Homes

## Description

Purrmanent Homes was founded to be a user friendly pet adoption website. Our team was motivated by making it easier to adopt a pet or put your pet up for adoption. By keeping a clean UI and responsive app, we were able to achieve this. Too often modern websites include too much fluff or third party features that distract from the purpose of the website. Throughout this process, we have learned how to better implement mutations and queries instead of routers. Outside of the technical side, we succeeded at working as a team and maintaining good communication and best coding practices.
